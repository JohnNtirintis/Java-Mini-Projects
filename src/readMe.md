# Theater Booking System

This is a simple theater booking system developed in Java. It allows you to book seats, cancel bookings, and view the current status of all seats in the theater.

## Features

1. **Book a seat**: You can book a seat given its row and column details.
2. **Cancel a booking**: You can cancel a booking if you no longer need it.
3. **Display seat status**: The system will display the current status of all seats in the theater. Booked seats are represented with a red circle and available seats with a green circle.
4. The program continues running, allowing multiple operations until you choose to exit.
