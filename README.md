# Java Mini Projects

This repository contains the source code for the ten mini projects developed as a part of Chapter 10 from the Full-Stack Development Bootcamp by the Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB).

These projects encompass various aspects of Java programming and are excellent resources for anyone trying to learn Java or refine their existing knowledge.

## Contents

This repository will eventually consist of 10 java projects. 

1. **Theater Booking System**: This is a console-based application designed to facilitate the booking and cancellation of seats in a theater. The system features a seating chart of 30 (1-30) rows and 12 columns (A-L). Users can easily book a seat by providing the row number and column letter, or cancel an existing booking using the same information. The application maintains a real-time chart showing the booked and available seats using clear visual indicators, a red X for booked seats and a green check mark for available ones. This system demonstrates the use of arrays, exception handling, and user interaction in Java.
2. **TicTacToe**: This is a Java-based implementation of the popular TicTacToe game. The game features a console interface, transforming your terminal into an interactive gaming platform. It comprises a single TicTacToeApp class with methods for game management, player moves, input validation, and result determination. Whether you're learning Java, exploring console-based applications, or just looking for a fun pastime, this straightforward yet engaging project serves the purpose.

## Installation
